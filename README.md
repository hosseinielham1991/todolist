# To-Do List Manager

This to-do list management application created with React helps you manage your daily tasks. It allows you to track tasks with three statuses: 'Todo', 'Progress', and 'Done'. Your task list is saved in the browser's local storage to ensure you don't lose your progress.

## Features

- **Create tasks:** Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Track progress:** Update the status of tasks through 'Todo', 'Progress', and 'Done'.
- **Persistence:** Data is saved in local storage for later retrieval.
